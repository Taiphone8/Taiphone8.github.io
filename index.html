                <p>My game only has a few completley finished areas. For not playing a lot of RPG games I think I did a pretty decent job. The best part of my game is definitely the decorations. The game starts off with just you but you can make friends along the way. You have access to cool abilities you can find around the map with exploring you just have to be adventorous.</p>
